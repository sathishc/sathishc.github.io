Today was special. I logged in at 950AM and found that there were 48 tickets available. I left the window open to keep the session alive. But a few minutes of distraction and at 10 the session had expired!. Oh No!. My heart started beating very fast.

Then I reloaded the site to get the home page. All i could see was the blank page and the spinner icon. I waited patiently (though there was some nail biting) and the page loaded after two minutes. The time was 10:03.

I already had the login / password saved using LastPass. So I clicked login. Nothing. What could be the issue?

I clicked again and to my relief saw the spinner wheel again. I knew I was competing with a few million such requests.

Patience was the key. I took a few deep breaths. 5 minutes. The time is now 10:09AM. And then the page loaded !!

I had memorized the station codes and the dates. I clicked “Find Trains” and this time the page loaded quickly to my surprise. I selected the train. There were still 22 tickets available. I knew I was behind but all was not lost.

I quickly entered the details and chose the best possible credit card options. I knew I needed to 70% probability of completing the reservation. In another couple of minutes I was entering my Citibank IPIN.

I was elated to see the “Redirecting to Merchant” site. I heard the sweet tune of SMS, when money gets deducted from your bank account. But I knew that it was not over…… It was not the finish line yet.

And then it happened. The most beautiful HTML page I have ever seen. Those words which said CONFIRM

Ecstasy. And then. Relief.
