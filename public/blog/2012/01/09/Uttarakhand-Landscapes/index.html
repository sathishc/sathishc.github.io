<div class="entry-content">We travelled to Uttarakhand during the X&#8217;Mas vacation of 2011 hoping to catch snow. We did not see any snow but some of the places visited were breathtaking in beauty. I want to share details of our trip so others can plan similar trips.

<br/><br/>
We had a full-week to spend. Our original plan was to visit Kullu-Manali, but while planning I realized we would either do too much or get bored. So I looked out for similar places that had a chance of snowfall and ended up planning this trip. Our itinerary was Bangalore-Delhi-Dehradun-Mussourie-Uttarkashi-Rishikesh-Haridwar-Delhi-Bangalore. As this blog post is on Uttarakhand landscape, it covers the first 4 days from Mussourie to Haridwar.
<br/><br/>
We took the afternoon flight from Bangalore to make sure we dont end up with cancelled flights due to Delhi winter fog. Our flight landed in Delhi around 5pm and our next connection was the midnight train to Dehradun. As we had a few hour to kill in Delhi, we hired a cab to show us around some of the sights that we had missed in our previous trip to Delhi. We visited India Gate and attempted Lal-Quila. On the way to India gate our cabbie took us around Rashtrapati Bhavan and Rajpath. Delhi was pleasant and beautiful at night.

    <div align="center">India Gate at Night</div>
</p>
After our brief tour of old-Delhi, we ended up at NDLS (New Delhi Station). To our surprise, we found long queues for travellers to get into the station. The queues extended to the road outside and it was freezing. Apparently, one has to get their luggage through a security scanner and hence this queue. The whole process was insane as the scanners were barely attended. People were throwing luggage through the machine and jumping to the other side to grab their baggage and run for the train.

<br/><br/>
For someone from Bangalore, the crowd and hassle was overwhelming. Somehow we got through and boarded the night train to Dehradun. The train arrived in Dehradun at 6am sharp.

I had a cab organized through MakeMyTrip for the rest of the journey till Haridwar. To our surprise our taxi was not at the station - when I called him up, the guy says he just woke up and needs to start from Roorkee and it would take 1.5 hrs to reach Dehradun. We had to spend our time freezing in the station until he appeared at 7.30am. It was heavenly to get into the heated Indigo.

<h4>Day-1 (Mussourie)</h4>

Our stay was booked in Mussourie and Dehradun to Mussourie is a pleasant 2 hrs road trip. We stopped at a few places en-route for coffee. The sky was beautiful and I could make some pretty photographs :-)
<p style="text-align: center;">

We stayed at the Padmini Nivas Hotel in Mussourie. Luckily for us we got a room which opened out to the Dehradun valley below. If you are planning to book here - ask for this room (#10 if I remember correctly) as it is the best possible view from this hotel. We checked-in, had a wonderful breakfast (continental and yummy alu-parathas). We spent some time hanging around the resort and then headed to see Kempty falls.
<p style="text-align: center;">

Kempty falls is a crowded, commercial waterfall park which you could easily avoid if you are expecting to see anything natural. But if your spouse is interested in shopping in a flea market, visit this place by all means. I managed to catch some pictures of the falls without people pushing and pulling me. The good experience I remember is having wonderful aloo-tikki&#8217;s and chai - as it was quite cold, the snack was even more enjoyable. The wife on the other hand had a whale of a time shopping for Tibetan shawls and other stuff that you find in any flea market.

We headed back to the hotel after a couple of hours and visited the Mussourie Gunhill in the evening. Gunhill is easily accessible from the main Mall road via a cable car. We took a cycle-rickshaw From our hotel to the rope-way and reached in 10 minutes. If you are visiting Mussourie in winter, check out the time of sunset and plan accordingly. The himalayan views from Gunhill is quite beautiful. You can see the late evening colors on the mountains vividly from Gunhill

<h4>
Day-2 (Dhanaulti)
</h4>

The next day we had planned a trip to Dhanaulti. Dhanaulti is a beautiful valley about 25kms from Mussourie and commands compelling views of himalayas. We visited the eco-park with deodar trees and spent a good 2-3 hours within the park.
<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="padding: 5px;" title="Dhanolti Eco Park" src="http://www.pixterous.com/Landscapes/Uttarakhand-India/i-GZVNGb8/0/M/Uttkhand-2693-M.jpg" alt="Dhanolti Eco Park" />

</p>
One of the interesting things about Uttarakhand is the unbelievable number of &#8220;Maggie&#8221; joints all over - there are Maggi points, Maggi palaces, and Maggi corners everywhere. Needless to say we had maggi at the park.

We hit a place called Lal-tibba (one of the highest points near Mussourie) on our way back from Dhanolti - the ride to lal-tibba was one hell of a journey. I am not sure who was more scared; us or our cab driver - he kept complaining that we should return back to the hotel instead. But we persisted and got to see some magnificent sunset views ever. After the lal-tibba ride, we decided to call it a day.

<h4>
Day-3 (Mussourie to Uttarkashi)
</h4>

We headed to Uttarkashi on the third day. My research with google maps suggested we would have to go through Tehri, but the locals suggested a new road which takes us to Uttarkashi much faster (not in google yet). This route had breathtaking views of the mountains toward Uttarkashi and a major high-light of the trip. If you take this route stop at Tingling point near Mouryana Ramp. The himalayan views here is simply mind boggling. Though most of our journey was pleasant, the construction work on the roads closer to Uttarkashi was a damper. It took us almost 2 hours to cover the last 20 kms. At Uttarkashi we stayed at the <a title="Monal Tourist Home" href="http://www.monaluttarkashi.com/">Monal Tourist Home</a>

<h4>
Day-4 (Uttarkashi)
</h4>

Monal is a beautiful lodge located a little north of Uttarkashi town. It has a splendid view of the surrounding hills and the Ganges (Assi Ganga) flows very close across the highway. You can hear the water flowing over the rocks from the lodge itself that adds to the experience. I hit the ganges early morning at Monal at around 6:30am to catch the sunrise and the Ganga. The rocks and Ganga is a view that you get all the way from Uttarkashi to Gangotri.

<div align="center">Ganges next to Monal</div></p>
Uttarkashi offers many beautiful hikes and treks for serious trekkers and mountaineers. For a family travelling with a 4 year old, there were a couple of treks suggested - 1) trek to Nachiketa Tal and 2) a trek to the waterfall at Barsu. We decided to travel to the waterfall at Barsu. The trip involved a 25km drive to the village of Barsu (at 7000ft) and then a 3km round-trip to the waterfall. The journey to Barsu by the ganga was another fantastic experience. Many hanging bridges cutting across the river provide exceptional photo opportunities. Check out the Nalluna bridge north of the Maneri dam

<h4>
Day-5 (Uttarkashi to Haridwar)
</h4>

We started early on this day from Uttarkashi towards Haridwar. The route was via Chamba rather than via Mussourie. This route takes one through a different side of Uttarakhand. We got to see more beautiful views at Dharasu, and Chamba on the way back. The himalayan view from Chamba was the most beautiful of all vintage points and was fitting way to conclude the landscape journey.
