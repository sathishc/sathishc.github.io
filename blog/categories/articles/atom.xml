    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I worked on an idea for discovery of books a couple of years ago. The idea was simple - make a catalog of your paper books
online and tag your location to it. Friends and neighbours would then be able to search for a book using the service and
discover books in your shelf. The service would allow making requests for books and manage subsequent interactions between
users. I tried developing this concept in residential communities, colleges and online book groups but did not get significant
traction to pursue it as a serious business.</p>

<p>In the couple of years that followed there were many others who approached or discussed the same idea online and otherwise.
I discouraged some of the folks explaining my experiences with traction. I am sure many more would want to try it out. But
the fact that there are many people with the same idea points to a possible passionate market however small it maybe. Most of
the code I had developed was lying idle and I thought it would help folks trying to build this concept from scratch if I
open sourced the codebase.</p>

<p>In the last few weeks I refactored the old code and built out a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareprism.localreads.ver1">mobile app</a> with the same backend, but used newer technologies
to build better capabilities and with less code. I have published the app for free on Android platform. You can check it out
at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareprism.localreads.ver1">here</a>. The code is open source and published in github.</p>

<p><img src="/images/localreads-android-page.png" alt="localreads" /></p>

<p>The android app is developed using the <a href="http://www.ionicframework.com">Ionic-Angular framework</a> that lets you build hybrid
(html + native) apps. The backend service is implemented as a set of REST apis using <a href="http://www.grails.org">Grails</a> with
a MongoDB database. You can check out the code on github at the following locations.</p>

<ul>
<li>LocalReads Mobile App Codebase - <a href="https://github.com/sathishc/localreads">https://github.com/sathishc/localreads</a></li>
<li>LocalReads backend service - <a href="https://github.com/sathishc/localreads-service">https://github.com/sathishc/localreads-service</a></li>
</ul>


<p>See instructions for building the codebase in the corresponding github repositories. The front end code uses Protractor/Jasmine for
End-to-End testing and Karma/Jasmine for unit tests. The backend uses Spock framework for testing the apis.</p>

<p>The code base will help developers trying to build similar capabilities for other apps - location
based full-text search, real-time messaging, restful and stateless service, hybrid mobile app using cordova, etc</p>

<p>To build a full stateless restful service in grails I have used the <a href="https://github.com/alvarosanchez/grails-spring-security-rest">Spring Security Rest plugin</a>
as the normal spring security based authentication relies on sessions to be maintained. Real-time messaging is
implemented using <a href="http://grails.org/plugin/spring-websocket">Spring Websockets</a>. Reach out if you are looking for help in these areas.</p>
